      <h2>A platform for the chess player, built by a chess player</h2>
      <p>JacksChess was built by me, Jack Mallers. I've been playing chess for most of my 21 years. And for the last few years, I have been obsessed with finding a better way for us players to connect and learn the game. And since I couldn't find one, I decided to build one.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It has always frustrated me that the experience of sitting over a chess board is limited by physical distance. I couldn't have a pleasant learning experience with a GM from Russia because I am in Chicago. My former high school chess teammates and I couldn't show each other our recent games because everyone had gone off to college in different states. Yeah, I know about the ICC/chess.com/FICS/teamviewer/Skype/SomeWindowsSoftware hack, but c'mon there needed to be better way, a superior tool built to connect players and support the best chess-learning experience.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Out of that frustration and my enduring love for the game of chess, I made this tool and continue to work and build it.</p>
