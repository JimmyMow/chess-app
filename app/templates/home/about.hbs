      <h2>A platform for the chess player, built by a chess player</h2>
      <p>JacksChess was built by me, Jack Mallers. I've been playing chess for most of my 21 years. And for the last few years, I have been obsessed with finding a better way for us players to connect and learn the game. And since I couldn't find one, I decided to build one.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It has always frustrated me that the experience of sitting over a chess board is limited by physical distance. I couldn't have a pleasant learning experience with a GM from Russia because I am in Chicago. My former high school chess teammates and I couldn't show each other our recent games because everyone had gone off to college in different states. Yeah, I know about the ICC/chess.com/FICS/teamviewer/Skype/SomeWindowsSoftware hack, but c'mon there needed to be better way, a superior tool built to connect players and support the best chess-learning experience.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Out of that frustration and my enduring love for the game of chess, I made this tool and continue to work and build it.</p>

          <h4>Drawing tools</h4>
          <p>Our energy and our health is what enables us to be effective. How we spend our time off (proper rest, exercise, and renewal) is as important as how we spend our time "on".</p>

          <h4>Happy you = Productive you</h4>
          <p>Our most productive days are days when we are at our personal best. Staying upbeat by achieving our goals and practicing daily gratitude is crucial to our emotional health.</p>

          <h4>Be Kind To Yourself</h4>
          <p>It's better to be nice to ourselves than to feel guilty about procrastinating or missing deadlines. Being forgiving in the short term prevents burn out in the long term.</p>

          <p>Our user's progress is made outside of our apps. Our job is to make tools that that stay out of their way so they spend <em>less</em> time in our apps and more time in their real work.</p>
