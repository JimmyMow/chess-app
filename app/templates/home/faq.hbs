      <h3><a href="#1"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>How does Jackschess help me as a player?</h3>
      <p>Jackschess gives you the ability to connect with any chess player in the world and all the necissary tools, all in one screen, to create the perfect online chess environemnt. Not only can you review with coaches 1 on 1 or in groups, but you can also hop on to review a game you just played with your opponent, show your friends all over the world your last tourney games, etc.</p>
      <p>There is a big disconnect between the learning expierence you get in person with other players and what you get online from sites like chess.com, ICC, chess24, etc. No matter how good technology gets, Tactics Trainer will never be as good as a titled player reviewing your games and openings with you. Jackschess brings that in person expierence to the internet.</p>

      <h3><a href="#2"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>How does Jackschess help me as a coach?</h3>
      <p>Jackschess will help you teach chess better online, and potentially get you more students.</p>
      <p>Nobody likes having to manage Skype/ICC or chess.com in the same screen, not to mention things like TeamViwer or programs that only Windows users can download. Group lessons are always a mess, you don't have all the features you need, etc. Skype and those websites aren't meant for a chess learning environment, Jackschess is. Jackschess isn't designed for multiple things, it is meant to create the perfect chess environemnt for players to connect and enjoy the game all over the internet.</p>
      <p>Jackschess also designed {{#link-to 'home.signup'}}accounts{{/link-to}} specifically for coaches. Having an account lets you have your own Jackschess room at your own personal URL. You also get a coaches toolbox where you can save positions, puzzles, games, recordings, etc. for later reuse in other lessons.</p>

      <h3><a href="#3"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>How much does Jackschess cost?</h3>
      <p><b>Free!</b> Literally, as of now, no part of using Jackschess cost anything at all. I'm not sure what jackschess.com's plan is for the future, so for now I'm just a 21 year old programmer trying to help the game of chess and the people that play it.</p>

      <h3><a href="#4"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>What's the difference between a Jackschess room and a jackschess account?</h3>
      <p>Great question.</p>
      <p>A chess room is a place on the internet where you have video chat, a chess board, and a bunch of chess specific features all in one screen. It is hosted at a unique URL that you can share to invite whoever you want. However, a chess room is hosted at a random URL, anyone can join it, and you cannot save any data like positions, puzzles, games, etc.</p>
      <p>An account comes with your own profile to market yourself as a coach or student, and it comes with your own personal chess room. Your own chess room is hosted at a customized URL. For example my username is "JimmyMow", so my room is http://jackschess.com/jimmymow/room. Because I have an account that room is also protected by a password or what I call a "room secret", so that only the people you give your secret to can enter your room. Lastly, an account comes with a toolbox, which you can save positions, games, puzzles, lessons, etc to.</p>
